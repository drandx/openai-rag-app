This video is only under Stunde Oh Am I loud and clear I'm not breaking up, am I still your charm? I'm not just that luck, are we getting closer? Are we just getting more lost? I'll show you mine if you show me yours first Let's compare scars, I'll tell you who's It is worse, let's unlight these pages and replace them with the wrong ones We live on front porches and swim like a boy We get by just fine here, I've been in the way The flow is a labor, I'll sleep till the end I'll cross these streets until you hold my hand I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow I've got some friends, some that I hardly know But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go We live on front porches and swim like a boy We get by just fine here, I've been in the way The flow is a labor, I'll sleep till the end I'll cross these streets until you hold my hand Until you hold my hand I'll show you mine, if you show me yours first Let's compare scars, I'll tell you, it's worse and lots Sunrise these pages and replace them with a round one We live on front porches and swim like a boy We get by just fine here, I'll never know where it's The flow is a labor, I'll sleep till the end I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand We live on front porches and swim like a boy
